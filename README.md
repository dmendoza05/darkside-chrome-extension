# WIP: Darkside Chrome Extension

Creating a chrome extension that can easily bring any webpage into the darkside(darkmode).

Advantages of going to the darkside:

- Less headaches and eyestrains.
- Looks way cooler.
- Can extend and increase productivity at night.
- No need to wear sunglasses inside the house and/or during nightime just to browse the web.

This Chrome extension aims to:

- Add a darkmode filter on most websites.

Got the idea from https://github.com/radibit/jira-dark-theme
